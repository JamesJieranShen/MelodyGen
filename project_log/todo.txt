Fix:
- Fix absolute path file reference (generate)

Parsing:
- Implement Music21 to parse MIDI
- Implement Music21 to Note/Chord

Project:
- Implement multithreading
- Implement saving/loading
- Implement real-time command-line interface?
- Implement MIDI CC controls
- Implement Keyboard input => Phrase?

Chord:
- Implement Chord

Phrase:
- Implement offset (each note has an offset within phrase, not neccessarily
    determiend by length, so that multiple notes can be played overlapping -
    requires multithreading)
- Implement mutate (with 'type' input - all, note, length, etc.)
- Implement generate phrase (based on algorithm)
- Implement Signature object?
- Implement different algorithms? 

Note:
- Implement is_valid (midi note between 0 and 127)
- Implement mutate_prob
- Change length and length_mod to Fractions
- Implement accent

Scale:
- Implement get_scale_degree method - returns a copy of a note
  at a certain scale degree
- Implement a get_note method - each note in scale has a certain
  probablity of being chosen (some more than others)

Signature:
- Numerator
- Denominator
- Accent boolean array (could be none)

Build:
- Add AWS S3 script
